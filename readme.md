# Templatized Ds
Data Structure Implementations using Generics.

## Prerequisites
* CMake
* GCC/clang/Mingw compiler
* C/C++ Extensions - for vsCode


## Getting Started

### VsCode/Clion
* Clone the project
```
git clone https://github.com/Nyanjuimarvin/Templatized-DS.git
```
* open the project in the IDE and wait for the indexing to complete

* Move into the generated build directory and run CMake
```
cmake ..
```

* Use
```
make
```
or
```
cmake --build .
```
to generate an executable.

* Run the executable/built target
```
./Templatized_DS
```

### Other 
* Clone the project
```
git clone https://github.com/Nyanjuimarvin/Templatized-DS.git
```

* Create a build directory in the project root directory

```
mkdir build
```

* Move into the build directory and run CMake
```
cmake ..
```

* Use
```
make
```
or
```
cmake --build .
```
to generate an executable.

* Run the executable/built target
```
./Templatized_DS
```

### Example
The main function in runList.cpp has a List initialized with integer types. If you wish to try other types, create a List with your preferred data type in the same function.

### To Do
* Add List Traversal Methods
